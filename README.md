# Plover Paste

A meta plugin for [Plover](https://github.com/openstenoproject/plover), which adds the ability to paste text from the clipboard.

## Usage

All you need to do to use this plugin is to make a dictionary entry mapping to `{:paste}`. Once you've done that, you can hit whichever stroke you specified and it will output the contents of your clipboard.

```json
"PA*EUFT": "{:paste}"
```
